/**
 * GeoAssist Material Design 3 Typography Configuration
 *
 * This file defines the typography system for the GeoAssist application using Material Design 3
 * principles. The typography configuration uses the default Material 3 Typography with system fonts,
 * ensuring consistency and readability across all text elements in the application.
 *
 * The AppTypography value can be customized in the future to include custom fonts, weights, and
 * sizes specific to GeoAssist branding requirements.
